		<h1>Block 1.2 - Length and Angles</h1>
		<div class="document">
<p>In this chapter lengths and angles are discussed. If you've used Ogre or any modern 3D engine before, then it is more than likely you've encountered the Vector and Quaternion classes.</p>
<div class="section" id="lengths-and-distances">
<h1>Lengths and Distances</h1>
<p>We should all know what lengths are, we use them all day. From estimating the distance when throwing a ball, to measuring the length of your waist to see if you will fit into that pair of trousers from when you were younger.</p>
<p>Mathamatically they are described as the differences between two points in space. The difference between lengths and distances is, the subject matter. Lengths are the difference between two points of the same connected body; a car, house, or a person. Distances are between two points of that are not connected; two cars, two houses, or two people.</p>

<p><strong>Question 1.1</strong></p>
<p>John and I are going to football practise for the first time. After looking at the map, we find it is about 1000 metres away. Halfway through, we notice that the football field is only 30 metres across someone's garden.</p>
<p>If we hop over the garden; How what is the distance we would of walked, and how much of the journey did we save?</p>

<p>Our term of &quot;length&quot; are still pretty generic. There are many variations of the word; <em>Breadth</em>, <em>Width</em>, <em>Thickness</em>, even <em>Radius</em> and <em>Diameter</em> could be lengths.</p>
<p>So what is exactly a length? Well, a measurement of a dimension of an object is a good definition, a better one would be it's the length between two extreme points of an object. This tree is three metres tall, that house is 12 metres wide, my car's rims are 50 centimetres in diameter.</p>

<p>In NxOgre, you'll be using different types of lengths to describe different shapes. You've already met a the <strong>Box</strong>, in the above diagram, but here is a list of the other shapes that uses lengths:</p>

<colgroup>
<col width="36%" />
<col width="64%" />
</colgroup>

<tr><td><strong>Capsule</strong></td>
<td>Radius and Height</td>

<tr><td><strong>Wheel</strong></td>

</tbody>

<p>Some shapes don't use lengths atll; Convex and Triangle Geometries for example. Ground shape is the most peculiar it uses distances and directions!</p>
<p>You'll meet more of the shapes in a later chapter, and blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Question 1.2</strong></p>
<p>My sister and I are trying to break a world record by stacking wooden blocks on top of each other into a tower. We are not sure how high the tower is. But we know how many blocks we used, and the width and length of the tower.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Blocks</strong> 15000</p>

<h1>Vectors</h1>
<p>To express lengths, distances and of course directions in NxOgre, we use a vector. If you've ever taken an advanced course in Mathmatics then yes, the vector is exactly like a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector">vector</a>.</p>
<p><div class="image-center"><img src="vector1.png" /></div></p>
<p>At first glance a vector is just a point in space, as it carries the x, y, z components with it. Depending on the use of the vector it may be a coordinate, size or a normal.</p>
<div class="section" id="coordinates">
<h2>Coordinates</h2>
<p>Coordinates you should be already familar with. They are simply distances in each dimension away from another point.</p>
<div class="equation-block"><img src="eq/63c63366928b92783f7b22eea8c264e9.png" alt="\mathbf{V} = \begin{pmatrix}
 2.0 \
 6.0 \
 4.0 \
\end{pmatrix}" /></div>
<p>Coordinates may be refered in &quot;Global Frame&quot; or &quot;Local Frame&quot;, the difference being is how they refer to an arbitrary point. In Global Space, a giraffe paperweight's position would be in reference to the world center (0,0,0), where as in local space the paperweights position would be refered to where the paperweight is placed upon or attached to; i.e. a piece of paper.</p>
<p><div class="image-center"><img src="referenceframes.png" /></div></p>
<p>In NxOgre, nearly everything is referred to in the Global frame, but in Ogre due to the use of the Scene Graph global and local frame are used frequently.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="normals">
<h2>Normals</h2>
<p>Normals can represent velocities, directions and direction of faces of triangles.</p>
<p><div class="image-center"><img src="vector3.png" /></div></p>
<p>Although normals are vectors, they are technically two components; a magnitude (length of the vector), and normalised direction. The magnitude is the length of the line between the world center (0,0,0) to the normal position; e.g. (10,12,5) and the direction is the norm of the vector:</p>

<h2>NxOgre::Vec3</h2>
<p>In NxOgre, Ogre and PhysX a class is reserved to hold three dimensional components; x,y,z as Real types. PhysX refers them as NxVec3 which most likely you'll never see, NxOgre are named <em>Vec3</em> and Ogre's are called Vector3.</p>
<p>They are all similarly structured as so:</p>
<div class="code-block"><pre><span class="r">namespace</span> NxOgre
{
    <span class="r">class</span> <span class="cl">Vec3</span>
    {
        <span class="di">public</span>:
         Real x, y, z;
    };
}</pre></div>
<p>The x, y, z components are publically accesible and meant to be set directly, without the need of get/set functions.</p>
