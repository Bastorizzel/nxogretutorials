In this chapter lengths and angles are discussed. If you've used Ogre or any modern 3D engine before, then it is more than likely you've encountered the Vector and Quaternion classes. 

Lengths and Distances
=====================

We should all know what lengths are, we use them all day. From estimating the distance when throwing a ball, to measuring the length of your waist to see if you will fit into that pair of trousers from when you were younger.

Mathamatically they are described as the differences between two points in space. The difference between lengths and distances is, the subject matter. Lengths are the difference between two points of the same connected body; a car, house, or a person. Distances are between two points of that are not connected; two cars, two houses, or two people.

	**Question 1.1**

	John and I are going to football practise for the first time. Looking at the map, and it is 1000 metres away from my house.
	
	On the way about half way through, John has found a shortcut over someones garden which will save 300 metres off our journey. If we take the shortcut, how long is the new journey?
