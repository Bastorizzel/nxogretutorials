In this chapter lengths and angles are discussed. If you've used Ogre or any modern 3D engine before, then it is more than likely you've encountered the Vector and Quaternion classes. 

Lengths and Distances
=====================

We should all know what lengths are, we use them all day. From estimating the distance when throwing a ball, to measuring the length of your waist to see if you will fit into that pair of trousers from when you were younger.

Mathamatically they are described as the differences between two points in space. The difference between lengths and distances is, the subject matter. Lengths are the difference between two points of the same connected body; a car, house, or a person. Distances are between two points of that are not connected; two cars, two houses, or two people.

	**Question 1.1**

	John and I are going to football practise for the first time. After looking at the map, we find it is about 1000 metres away. Halfway through, we notice that the football field is only 30 metres across someone's garden.

	If we hop over the garden; How what is the distance we would of walked, and how much of the journey did we save?

Our term of "length" are still pretty generic. There are many variations of the word; *Breadth*, *Width*, *Thickness*, even *Radius* and *Diameter* could be lengths.

So what is exactly a length? Well, a measurement of a dimension of an object is a good definition, a better one would be it's the length between two extreme points of an object. This tree is three metres tall, that house is 12 metres wide, my car's rims are 50 centimetres in diameter.

In NxOgre, you'll be using different types of lengths to describe different shapes. You've already met a the **Box**, in the above diagram, but here is a list of the other shapes that uses lengths:

+-----------------+------------------------------+
| Shape           | Lengths used                 |
+=================+==============================+
| Box             | Width, Length and Height     |
+-----------------+------------------------------+
| **Sphere**      | Radius                       |
+-----------------+------------------------------+
| **Capsule**     | Radius and Height            |
+-----------------+------------------------------+
| **Wheel**       | Radius                       |
+-----------------+------------------------------+
| **HeightField** | Width and Length             |
+-----------------+------------------------------+

Some shapes don't use lengths atll; Convex and Triangle Geometries for example. Ground shape is the most peculiar it uses distances and directions!

You'll meet more of the shapes in a later chapter, and blocks.

    **Question 1.2**

    My sister and I are trying to break a world record by stacking wooden blocks on top of each other into a tower. We are not sure how high the tower is. But we know how many blocks we used, and the width and length of the tower.

    Assuming each block is the same size. How high is the tower?

    Blocks used 15000.
    Tower size; Width=25cm, Length=25cm 
    Block size; Width=5cm, Length=1cm, Height=1.5cm
